# Chapter_one
Here is the code for my phd Chapter one in University of East Anglia. There are three main segments.
-- Scrapy the data from Amazon, and then clean it.
-- We use the selenium to simulate the chorme to store the data into Sqlite database. By this way, we can convert the sales ranking 
into sales quantity data.
-- We use the Keepa.com API key to collect the data form Amazon. The raw data is daily data. Then we convert them into quarterly data by using our data.
-- Then we write the demand estimation regression and the merger simulation based on the theory in our paper.
